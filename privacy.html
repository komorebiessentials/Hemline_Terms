    <h1>Privacy Policy for Hemline</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: December 3, 2025</p>
    <p>Hemline ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Hemline.</p>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1. Location Data</h3>
    <p>We collect your precise location data (latitude and longitude) to provide you with accurate local weather forecasts. This data is fetched only when you use the app or when a background refresh is triggered. We do not store your historical location data on our servers; it is processed locally on your device and sent to our weather data provider to retrieve forecast information.</p>
    <h3>1.2. User Preferences</h3>
    <p>We store your personal preferences locally on your device to customize your experience. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity:</strong> Gender identity (e.g., Female, Male, Non-Binary).</li>
        <li><strong>Hair Type:</strong> Your hair texture (e.g., Straight, Wavy, Curly, Coily).</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature Unit:</strong> Your preferred unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).</li>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Your display name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is stored securely on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third party, except as part of the prompt sent to our AI service provider (OpenAI) to generate personalized advice.</p>
    <h3>1.3. Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect anonymous, aggregate usage data to help us improve the app's performance and user experience.</p>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide Services:</strong> To fetch local weather and generate personalized outfit and hair advice.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve Hemline:</strong> To understand how users interact with the app and identify areas for improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <h3>3.1. OpenAI</h3>
    <p>We use OpenAI's API to generate the "savage" and witty advice text. When you request advice, we send a text prompt containing your current weather conditions and your style preferences (e.g., "Wavy hair, hot weather") to OpenAI. We do not send your precise location coordinates or any personally identifiable information (PII) to OpenAI.</p>
    <p><a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a></p>
    <h3>3.2. Weather Data Provider</h3>
    <p>We use a third-party weather service to fetch forecast data based on your coordinates.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Hemline is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
